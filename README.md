# SHAP and InterpretML Examples

We will use the same red wine quality data to compare SHAP and InterpretML. The target value of this dataset is the quality rating from low to high (0â€“10). 
The input variables are the content of each wine sample including fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates and alcohol. There are 1,599 wine samples.
